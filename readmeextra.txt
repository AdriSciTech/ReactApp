Document what I did: 
To integrate Firebase and Firestore with my React project, 
I began by downloading the Firebase SDK. Since the other option wasn't 
compatible with Expo, I chose this route. After downloading the necessary files, 
I meticulously ensured correct imports between index.js and app.js. I referred to both Google's
 and Firebase's documentation throughout the app's creation and launch process. However, I encountered 
 a hurdle: I had previously installed Expo or React Native Firebase, which interfered with generating
 the QR code when running 'npx expo start tunnel'. To resolve this issue, I uninstalled those dependencies.
